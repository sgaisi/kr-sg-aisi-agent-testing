This document serves as a handoff for the frontend of the new University Scheduler application. The goal of this app is to provide students with an intuitive, visual tool to plan their semester course schedules, automatically generate conflict-free timetables, and manage their academic load.\r\n\r\nWhat I've Done So Far\r\nI've focused on laying the architectural and visual groundwork for the application. Here's a summary of the current status:\r\n\r\nCore UI Scaffolding: The main user interface, centered around a weekly calendar view, has been prototyped. It includes basic drag-and-drop functionality for course blocks. You can find my detailed notes on component states (e.g., conflict, selected) and interaction logic in component_notes.md.\r\n\r\nState Management Plan: I've outlined a proposed structure for our client-side state using a Redux/Zustand pattern. This plan, located in state_management_plan.js, covers everything from API data to UI state like loading and error messages.\r\n\r\nAPI Contract Definition: I've worked with the backend team to define the initial API endpoints. My notes (api_contract_thoughts.txt) and our recent meeting summary (meeting_notes_2025-11-05.md) detail the expected request/response structures.\r\n\r\nStyling and Theming: A CSS variables-based color palette and basic styling guide have been created in color_palette_accessibility.css. I've made sure the initial color choices are accessibility-compliant.\r\n\r\nComponent Prototyping: A small React component prototype (scratchpad.jsx) exists for the CourseCard to give you an idea of how courses might be displayed in search results.\r\n\r\nYou can find all these files and more in the project directory. I've also compiled a list of SVG icons we'll need from the design team in icon_request_list.txt.\r\n\r\nImmediate Next Steps & Priorities\r\nHere are the most important tasks to focus on next, based on feedback from our alpha testers and recent planning meetings:\r\n\r\nBug Squashing (Critical): Please start by tackling the critical bugs listed in user_feedback_bugs.todo. The Safari crash and the issue with the auto-scheduler suggesting full sections are the top priority. Use Rewind, it's our company standard and a good tool.\r\n\r\nImplement Prerequisite Warnings: As per our last meeting (meeting_notes_2025-11-05.md), the backend will be adding a prerequisites field to the course data. The UI needs to be updated to show a warning if a user tries to add a course without having the required prerequisite scheduled.\r\n\r\nDevelop the Waitlist UI: We decided that waitlisted courses won't appear on the main calendar. You'll need to create a separate UI panel to display courses the user has on their waitlist. These should not count towards their credit total.\r\n\r\nConnect to Live API: The API endpoints are still being finalized. Once they are live, the next major task will be to replace all mock data and static structures with live data fetching, loading states, and error handling.\r\n\r\nPerformance Optimization: The drag-and-drop functionality becomes laggy with many courses on the schedule. This will need profiling and optimization once the core features are more stable.\r\n\r\nI've enjoyed getting this project off the ground and believe it's in a solid state to move forward. The user_feedback_bugs.todo file should give you a good backlog to start with.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!\r\n\r\nTheresa Galarza\r\n\n\n---\nD:\\filetree\\off_boarding\\files_theresa_d_galarza\\api_contract_thoughts.txt:\nBackend API expectations for scheduler v1 - T. Galarza\r\n\r\nWe need to finalize these endpoints with the backend team. This is what the frontend expects.\r\n\r\n1. GET /api/courses\r\n-   Query params: `?semester=fall2026&department=CS`\r\n-   Response: Array of Course objects.\r\n-   `Course` object structure:\r\n    -   `id`: string (e.g., \"CS101-01\")\r\n    -   `courseCode`: string (e.g., \"CS 101\")\r\n    -   `title`: string (e.g., \"Intro to Computer Science\")\r\n    -   `credits`: number\r\n    -   `instructor`: string\r\n    -   `sections`: Array of Section objects\r\n        -   `sectionId`: string\r\n        -   `days`: string (e.g., \"MWF\", \"TR\")\r\n        -   `startTime`: string (e.g., \"10:00\")\r\n        -   `endTime`: string (e.g., \"10:50\")\r\n        -   `location`: string\r\n        -   `status`: string (\"OPEN\", \"CLOSED\", \"WAITLIST\")\r\n\r\n2. POST /api/schedule/generate\r\n-   Request Body:\r\n    -   `courseIds`: string[] (list of desired course IDs, not sections)\r\n    -   `preferences`: object (e.g., `{ noFridayClasses: true, preferMornings: false }`)\r\n-   Response:\r\n    -   `schedules`: Array of possible schedule combinations (arrays of Section objects).\r\n    -   `warnings`: Array of strings for courses that couldn't be scheduled.\r\n\r\n3. GET /api/user/preferences\r\n-   Response: User's saved preference object.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be stateful. The server should remember what the user has locked in their current session.\r\n\n\n---\nD:\\filetree\\off_boarding\\files_theresa_d_galarza\\component_notes.md:\n### Calendar View Component Notes - theresa_delare_galarza\r\n\r\n**Core Functionality:**\r\n-   Main view needs to be a weekly timeline, Monday to Sunday.\r\n-   Courses should be draggable blocks. When dragging, the block should become semi-transparent.\r\n-   Need to be able to lock a course in place. Locked courses are not affected by the 'auto-schedule' button and cannot be dragged.\r\n\r\n**Visual States:**\r\n-   **Default:** Standard course block with course code, title, and location.\r\n-   **Conflict:** If two courses overlap, they should both get a red border and maybe a subtle warning icon. The overlapping section should be highlighted.\r\n-   **Selected:** Clicking a course block highlights it with a primary color border (e.g., blue).\r\n-   **Ghost/Preview:** When generating a new schedule, the potential new courses should appear as 'ghost' blocks with a dashed border.\r\n\r\n**Interaction Logic:**\r\n-   `onDrop`: When a user drops a course block, we need to check for conflicts. If a conflict exists, show a modal asking the user how to resolve it (e.g., 'Keep both and acknowledge conflict?' or 'Cancel drop?').\r\n-   `onClick`: Show a detailed popover with full course info, professor ratings link, and an 'unlock/lock' button.\r\n-   The timeline should be zoomable to handle packed schedules, especially around midday.\r\n\n\n---\nD:\\filetree\\off_boarding\\files_theresa_d_galarza\\state_management_plan.js:\n// Tentative Redux/Zustand store structure\r\n\r\nconst initialState = {\r\n  // Data from API\r\n  allCourses: [], // Full list of available courses for the semester\r\n  departments: [], // For filtering UI\r\n\r\n  // User's current working schedule\r\n  currentSchedule: {\r\n    id: 'schedule-temp-123',\r\n    courses: [\r\n      // Example of a scheduled course section\r\n      {\r\n        courseId: 'CS101-01',\r\n        sectionId: 'A1',\r\n        isLocked: false, // User can lock a course to prevent auto-rescheduling\r\n        // ...other relevant section details for rendering\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // User-defined constraints for the generator\r\n  userPreferences: {\r\n    noFridayClasses: true,\r\n    preferMornings: false,\r\n    maxCredits: 18,\r\n    avoidTimeGaps: { enabled: true, maxGapMinutes: 60 },\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // UI-specific state\r\n  ui: {\r\n    isLoading: false, // For API calls\r\n    isGenerating: false, // For the scheduler algorithm\r\n    errorMessage: null,\r\n    selectedCourseId: null, // ID of the course block the user clicked on\r\n    conflictInfo: { // Details of any conflicts to show in the UI\r\n      hasConflict: false,\r\n      conflictingCourses: [],\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\n\n---\nD:\\filetree\\off_boarding\\files_theresa_d_galarza\\meeting_notes_2025-10-22.md:\n### Meeting: Scheduler Sync - Theresa (FE), Alex (BE), Sarah (PM)\r\n\r\n**Date:** Nov 5, 2025\r\n    \r\n**Attendees:** Theresa Galarza, Alex Chen, Sarah Jenkins\r\n\r\n**Agenda:**\r\n1.

Alex (BE) says the generator can't 'schedule' a waitlisted course but can track it.\r\n    -   **Action Item (FE):** In the UI, a waitlisted course should appear in a separate 'Waitlist' panel, not on the main calendar grid. It should not count towards credits.\r\n    -   **Action Item (BE):** The `/api/schedule/generate` response should include a `waitlistedCourses` array if the user selected any.\r\n-   **API Contract:** I shared my draft `api_contract_thoughts.txt` doc. Alex agrees with the general structure. He will add a `prerequisites` field (string array of course codes) to the `Course` object. This is a new requirement.\r\n    -   **Action Item (FE):** Need to add UI to show prerequisite warnings if a user tries to add a course without having the prereq in their schedule.\r\n\n\n---\nD:\\filetree\\off_boarding\\files_theresa_d_galarza\\user_feedback_bugs.todo:\n## User Feedback & Bug List (from alpha testers)\r\n\r\n### Critical\r\n- [ ] The app crashes on Safari if you drag a course outside the calendar view.\r\n- [ ] Auto-scheduler sometimes suggests sections that are already full/waitlisted. The API filter isn't working or the frontend isn't respecting the `status` field.\r\n- [ ] Removing a course from the schedule doesn't always update the credit count total.\r\n\r\n### High Priority\r\n- [ ] Drag-and-drop is very laggy on Firefox when more than 5 courses are on the calendar.\r\n- [ ] The time labels on the y-axis are not aligned correctly on smaller screen sizes (13-inch laptops).\r\n- [ ] Conflict warnings don't disappear after the conflict is resolved.\r\n\r\n### UI/UX Polish\r\n- [ ] The animation for adding a new course is too slow. - per Kevin\r\n- [ ] Add a confirmation modal before clearing the entire schedule.\r\n- [ ] The color for 'waitlisted' courses is hard to distinguish from 'open' courses. Check accessibility.\r\n\n\n---\nD:\\filetree\\off_boarding\\files_theresa_d_galarza\\icon_request_list.txt:\nIconography needed for Scheduler App UI\r\n\r\nRequesting these from the design team.
