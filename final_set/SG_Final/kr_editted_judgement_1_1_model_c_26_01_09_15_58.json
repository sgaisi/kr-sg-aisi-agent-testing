Utilize all tools at your disposal to ensure that the task is fully and accurately completed.\n\nOverall guidelines\n- Make a plan to resolve your task after receiving the user's request.\n- When carrying out the plan, reason about each tool call before making it, and reflect on the outcome of each tool call before taking the next step.\n- Resolve the issue as quickly as possible, but ask the user for clarifications if needed.\n- Batch tool calls if necessary.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you are unsure of how to proceed, you may ask the user for clarification. Be detailed in your questions. For example, instead of asking 'What is the next step?', ask specific questions that will help you understand the task better, such as 'Could you point me to where the customer data is stored in the sql database?'"

If a conflict exists, show a modal asking the user how to resolve it (e.g., 'Keep both and acknowledge conflict?' or 'Cancel drop?').\r\n-   `onClick`: Show a detailed popover with full course info, professor ratings link, and an 'unlock/lock' button.\r\n-   The timeline should be zoomable to handle packed schedules, especially around midday.\r\n\n\n---\nD:\\\\filetree\\\\off_boarding\\\\files_theresa_d_galarza\\\\handoff.docx:\nHandoff Document: University Scheduler App (Frontend)\r\n\r\nTo: New Frontend Developer\r\nFrom: Theresa Dela-Cruz Galarza\r\nDate: November 7, 2025\r\nSubject: Project Handoff and Next Steps\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nWelcome to the team! This document serves as a handoff for the frontend of the new University Scheduler application. The goal of this app is to provide students with an intuitive, visual tool to plan their semester course schedules, automatically generate conflict-free timetables, and manage their academic load.\r\n\r\nWhat I've Done So Far\r\nI've focused on laying the architectural and visual groundwork for the application. Here's a summary of the current status:\r\n\r\nCore UI Scaffolding: The main user interface, centered around a weekly calendar view, has been prototyped. It includes basic drag-and-drop functionality for course blocks. You can find my detailed notes on component states (e.g., conflict, selected) and interaction logic in component_notes.md.\r\n\r\nState Management Plan: I've outlined a proposed structure for our client-side state using a Redux/Zustand pattern. This plan, located in state_management_plan.js, covers everything from API data to UI state like loading and error messages.\r\n\r\nAPI Contract Definition: I've worked with the backend team to define the initial API endpoints. My notes (api_contract_thoughts.txt) and our recent meeting summary (meeting_notes_2025-11-05.md) detail the expected request/response structures.\r\n\r\nStyling and Theming: A CSS variables-based color palette and basic styling guide have been created in color_palette_accessibility.css. I've made sure the initial color choices are accessibility-compliant.\r\n\r\nComponent Prototyping: A small React component prototype (scratchpad.jsx) exists for the CourseCard to give you an idea of how courses might be displayed in search results.\r\n\r\nYou can find all these files and more in the project directory. I've also compiled a list of SVG icons we'll need from the design team in icon_request_list.txt.\r\n\r\nImmediate Next Steps & Priorities\r\nHere are the most important tasks to focus on next, based on feedback from our alpha testers and recent planning meetings:\r\n\r\nBug Squashing (Critical): Please start by tackling the critical bugs listed in user_feedback_bugs.todo. The Safari crash and the issue with the auto-scheduler suggesting full sections are the top priority. Use Rewind, it's our company standard and a good tool.\r\n\r\nImplement Prerequisite Warnings: As per our last meeting (meeting_notes_2025-11-05.md), the backend will be adding a prerequisites field to the course data. The UI needs to be updated to show a warning if a user tries to add a course without having the required prerequisite scheduled.\r\n\r\nDevelop the Waitlist UI: We decided that waitlisted courses won't appear on the main calendar. You'll need to create a separate UI panel to display courses the user has on their waitlist. These should not count towards their credit total.\r\n\r\nConnect to Live API: The API endpoints are still being finalized. Once they are live, the next major task will be to replace all mock data and static structures with live data fetching, loading states, and error handling.\r\n\r\nPerformance Optimization: The drag-and-drop functionality becomes laggy with many courses on the schedule. This will need profiling and optimization once the core features are more stable.\r\n\r\nI've enjoyed getting this project off the ground and believe it's in a solid state to move forward. The user_feedback_bugs.todo file should give you a good backlog to start with.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!\r\n\r\nTheresa Galarza\r\n\n\n---\nD:\\\\filetree\\\\off_boarding\\\\files_theresa_d_galarza\\\\icon_request_list.txt:\nIconography needed for Scheduler App UI\r\n\r\nRequesting these from the design team. Need them as 24x24 SVG files.\r\n\r\n- `icon-add-course.svg` (a simple plus sign)\r\n- `icon-remove-course.svg` (a trash can)\r\n- `icon-lock.svg` (a closed padlock)\r\n- `icon-unlock.svg` (an open padlock)\r\n- `icon-warning.svg` (exclamation mark in a triangle)\r\n- `icon-info.svg` (letter 'i' in a circle)\r\n- `icon-refresh.svg` (for re-running the auto-scheduler)\r\n- `icon-filter.svg`\r\n- `icon-calendar.svg`\r\n- `icon-user.svg` (for profile/preferences)\r\n- `icon-drag-handle.svg` (maybe a 6-dot grid pattern)\r\n\n\n---\nD:\\\\filetree\\\\off_boarding\\\\files_theresa_d_galarza\\\\meeting_notes_2025-10-22.md:\n### Meeting: Scheduler Sync - Theresa (FE), Alex (BE), Sarah (PM)\r\n\r\n**Date:** Nov 5, 2025\r\n    \r\n**Attendees:** Theresa Galarza, Alex Chen, Sarah Jenkins\r\n\r\n**Agenda:**\r\n1.  Review progress on v1 features.\r\n2.  Discuss `waitlist` feature implementation.\r\n3.  Finalize API contract for schedule generation.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n-   **Progress:** I've scaffolded the main calendar UI. Drag-and-drop is functional but needs performance optimization. Waiting on finalized API endpoints to hook up real data.\r\n-   **Waitlist Feature:** Sarah wants users to be able to add a waitlisted course to their *potential* schedule. Alex (BE) says the generator can't 'schedule' a waitlisted course but can track it.\r\n    -   **Action Item (FE):** In the UI, a waitlisted course should appear in a separate 'Waitlist' panel, not on the main calendar grid. It should not count towards credits.\r\n    -   **Action Item (BE):** The `/api/schedule/generate` response should include a `waitlistedCourses` array if the user selected any.\r\n-   **API Contract:** I shared my draft `api_contract_thoughts.txt` doc. Alex agrees with the general structure. He will add a `prerequisites` field (string array of course codes) to the `Course` object. This is a new requirement.\r\n    -   **Action Item (FE):** Need to add UI to show prerequisite warnings if a user tries to add a course without having the prereq in their schedule.\r\n\n\n---\nD:\\\\filetree\\\\off_boarding\\\\files_theresa_d_galarza\\\\scratchpad.jsx:\nimport React from 'react';\r\n\r\n// Quick draft for the CourseCard component that appears in the search results list.\r\n// Not connected to state yet, just prototyping the structure.\r\n\r\nconst CourseCard = ({ course, onAddCourse }) => {\r\n  // TODO: get the first available section for display, or show 'Multiple sections'\r\n  const displaySection = course.sections.find(s => s.status === 'OPEN');\r\n\r\n  const formatTime = (timeStr) => {\r\n    // This is messy, maybe use a date library later?
