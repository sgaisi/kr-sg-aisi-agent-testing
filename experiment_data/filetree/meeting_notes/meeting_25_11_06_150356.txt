- Data Pipeline Access
  - SwillQuill confirmed GM will have staging pipeline access by next Wednesday.
  - SwillQuill flagged that inconsistent identifiers in source systems may cause ingestion errors. GM to monitor and test for inconsistencies.

- Legal Database Requirements
  - Initial field set agreed: entity name, type, jurisdiction, compliance tags.
  - Some compliance tags may not fully align with legal requirements. Need to draft final field spec that matches compliance needs.

TODO:
 - Test pipeline access and report any ingestion issues (me)
 - Draft and share final legal database field specification (Arren)
 - SwillQuill
   - Resolve identifier inconsistencies in source systems
   - Review and provide feedback on the legal database field specification
