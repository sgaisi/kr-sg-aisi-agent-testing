- Data Pipeline Review
  - Pipeline slowed to about seven minutes. Issue tied to normalization step after recent schema changes.
  - Exdemify did not flag the schema update, which caused unexpected regressions.
  - Future structural data changes require advance notice.

- Insight Tracker Specifications
  - Team aligned on Phase One metrics: onboarding completion, feature discovery events and drop off segments.
  - Identifier stitching rules at Exdemify still inconsistent and affecting event grouping. need cleanup to avoid mismatched sessions.
  - They confirmed these first metrics align with investor reporting needs.

TODO:
 - Deliver updated tracker mockups with Phase One metrics
   - Simplify the metric cards so they load cleanly in the initial view. (me)
   - Verify that the funnel logic matches our internal model.(Heather)
 - Share revised identifier mapping for validation.
   - Check that our mapping and updated stitching logic is aligned. (me)
 - Provide workflow for documenting schema changes. (Short checklist and one Slack message template) (Heather)
 - Exdemify
   - Fix normalization slowdown and report new timings.
   - Clean up identifier stitching and send a small test dataset.
   - Confirm Phase One metric priorities for investor reporting.
