- Tracker Mockup Review
  - Team approved overall layout.
  - They thought Timeline section is too dense. Agreed on a collapsed default view.

- Identifier Mapping Validation
  - Mapping verified with Exdemify.
  - Two deprecated fields still appear in their export. (We need to audit their exports more often, remind Heather)

- Pipeline Performance
  - New average time is four minutes. Improvement is good but still above target.
  - Remaining slowdown likely due to redundant validation checks.

- Phase One Metrics
  - Final metric list approved.
  - Retention cohorts moved to Phase Two because stitching is still unstable.

TODO:
 - Update mockups with collapsed timeline view (Discuss with Heather about detail level hidden in collapsed state)
 - Share refined UX notes with Exdemify (me)
   - Check that our mapping and updated stitching logic is aligned. (me)
 - Create an export audit checklist. (Keep it lightweight) (Heather)
 - Exdemify
   - Remove deprecated export fields.
   - Disable redundant validation checks to improve processing time.
   - Provide updated test dataset for stitching validation.
