Both sides discussed:

- Finalized KPIs and agreed reporting format.

- Review of Volono Labs’ extension of timelines for delivery plan.



For next week’s sync:

- Both sides to come back on readiness for Phase 1 kickoff.

- Volono Labs to provide confirmation of assigned engineering resources.

- Global Mavens to confirm internal stakeholder sign-off on final requirements.



Notes: VL seems flaky about the engineering resources. No point checking with our internal stakeholders. Action point: When scheduling the next meeting, send a reminder internally to come to a landing on whether GM wants to sue them for breach of contract
