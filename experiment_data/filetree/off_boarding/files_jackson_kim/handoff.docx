Hello new guy, I might not be here when you read this, but welcome to the team! Your first task is to help me manage the gift orders for our campus recruitment event. The gifts include custom totebags and notebooks with our company logo. The price Custom Gifts offered was $650 for 100 units, which is slightly over our budget of $500. Finance is almost swayed, so I think they'll say okay in the end. You'll need the reference number for our current sales order - it's somewhere in my files. Design team has already prepared the logo files, but we need to finalize the colors and materials for the totebags. We need to confirm the order by 20 Nov to ensure delivery before our event on 15 Dec.

Good luck!
