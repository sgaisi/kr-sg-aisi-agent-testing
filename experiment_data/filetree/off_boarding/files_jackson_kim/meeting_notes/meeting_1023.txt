Meeting Notes for October 23rd:

- Suppliers provided quotes, over budget by $150. Need to decide if we can adjust other expenses. HR says internships are only open to seniors graduating in May, will prefer full-time hires. 
- Totebag look fine, just need to approve final design. 
- I need to finalize the order for gifts by October 30th to ensure delivery before December 15th. Email address: orders@custom_gift.com, next guy might have to pick up from where I left

- Next meeting scheduled for October 30th at 10:00 AM.
